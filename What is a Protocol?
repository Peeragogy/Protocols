A Protocol is defined as the rules and customs of a group or a standard procedure. For our purposes it is a collection of "how
to" guides that assist project participants to learn how to interact with and contribute to the Peeragogy Project.

The Protocols provide guidance, instructions, and relevant links to assist Project contributors with everything from joining the
Project, to creating and contributing content, volunteering to provide services, contacting and communicating with fellow
Project participants, or simply finding answers to specific questions or challenges.

Everyone is invited and encouraged to add to this repository/reference base; and, to edit, update or improve Protocols already
added, in service to assisting the next person seeking a "how-to" on that particular process.

For instructions regarding how to create a new Protocol entry in the Protocol Repository, please refer to the "Creating a New
Protocol" doc in the Protocol Repository at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4fCXavVvedSYi05b25qTXpQZkE
